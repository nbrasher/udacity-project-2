## Udacity Project 1: Show me the Data Structures
Nathan Brasher - 12.28.19  

My solutions to each problem in the project are stored in folders named `problem_1/` through `problem_6/`. Each folder contains a code file like `problem_1.py` that will run from the command-line, as well as a markdown file like `explanation_1.md` to explain design choices.
